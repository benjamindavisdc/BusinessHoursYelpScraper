# Business Hours Scraper

This Python script is designed to help identify inconsistencies in online business hours listings. It automates the process of scraping business hours from websites and provides a convenient way to compare and analyze the data.

## Prerequisites

Before running this script, ensure that you have the following:

- Python installed on your machine (version 3.6 or higher).
- The required Python packages installed. You can install them by running the following command:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Usage
Follow the instructions below to use the Business Hours Scraper:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open a terminal and navigate to the cloned repository's directory:
```shell
cd business-hours-scraper
```

Create a file named urls.txt in the project directory. Each line in this file should contain the URL of a website you want to scrape business hours from. For example:
```arduino
https://example.com
https://anotherexample.com
```

Run the following command to start the scraping process:
```shell
python scrape_hours.py
```

The script will start visiting each URL in the urls.txt file, scrape the business hours information, and store it in a CSV file named business_hours.csv.

Once the script finishes scraping, you can analyze the data in the business_hours.csv file using your preferred tools, such as spreadsheet software or data analysis libraries.

#Customization
You can customize the script to suit your specific needs. Here are a few suggestions:

Adjust the scraping logic in the scrape_hours.py file to match the structure and location of business hours on the websites you are targeting.
Modify the CSV output format or include additional data fields according to your analysis requirements.
Add error handling or logging mechanisms to handle exceptions during the scraping process.
